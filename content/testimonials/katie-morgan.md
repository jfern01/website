*Amazingly efficient* is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Jose. I had the pleasure of working with Jose for over a year at the Crosby Interactive, collaborating on several projects. I was always in awe of how Jose could manage multiple projects and was quick with a response to any issues that would arise.

He has been incredible with helping me to become a better developer. He was a constant source of spirited conversation and debate. I still miss our weekly, friendly deliberation.

Jose is a clear asset to any team and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.
