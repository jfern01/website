Jose is a solid asset to the company. Normally Jose handles complex IT work requiring tremendous concentration and focus not easy for most.  But of late he has stepped up beyond his regular assignment taking on marketing tasks to further the overall success of the company. This has involved delicate interfacing on an international level that could not have been done without his participation. His versatilities are appreciated.
