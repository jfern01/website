I have worked with Jose at Crosby Interactive for about two years now and have grown to learn how impressive his skills are, both as a developer and a team member. During our two years working together, I realized how much of an asset he was to the team.

As a Project Manager, Jose was always the one to respond to the biggest challenges we faced and did it with ease. Not only is Jose technically skilled, he is also an extremely fun guy to work with.

I strongly recommend Jose if you are looking for an incredibly talented and driven individual.
