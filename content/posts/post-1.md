**This is the obligatory first post to celebrate the launch of my new portfolio site and blog.**

> Welcome, children! &nbsp; &mdash; Mose Schrute

I built this site to make it super easy to showcase my work. You probably noticed the speed, that's because I used [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), an excellent static site generator. The custom Gridsome theme is based on [kross](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-bootstrap-portfolio-template).

The site itself is hosted on Netlify, where I leverage Netlify forms to handle form submissions.

Here are my npm dependencies at the time the site went live:

```javascript

    "@gridsome/plugin-critical": "^0.1.6",
    "@gridsome/plugin-google-analytics": "^0.1.1",
